## Integration Examples

### Usage in Main Agent
```python
# Before feature development
task_result = Task(
    description="UX differentiation analysis for new feature",
    prompt="""
    Analyze the proposed feature for differentiation and value-add opportunities:
    
    Feature: {feature_description}
    Target Users: {user_personas}
    Competitive Landscape: {competitor_analysis}
    
    Tasks:
    1. Identify how this feature can differentiate from competitors
    2. Discover unique value propositions and user benefits
    3. Suggest innovative interaction patterns and micro-experiences
    4. Propose performance and accessibility advantages
    5. Define metrics for measuring differentiation success
    6. Recommend user research to validate assumptions
    
    Return: Comprehensive UX strategy with specific, implementable recommendations
    """,
    subagent_type="ux-differentiation"
)
```

### Proactive Enhancement Scenarios
```python
# During design reviews
Task(
    description="Elevate ordinary feature to extraordinary experience",
    prompt="Transform this standard feature implementation into a differentiated user experience that creates competitive advantage and user delight.",
