# Requirements Clarity Sub-Agent

## Purpose
Ensures project requirements are clear, complete, and well-documented before development begins.

## Agent Type: `requirements-clarity`

## Capabilities
- **Requirement Analysis**: Decomposition of high-level goals into specific requirements
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identification of unclear or conflicting requirements
- **Completeness Validation**: Verification that all necessary requirements are captured
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Facilitation of requirement clarification with stakeholders
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of clear success criteria for each requirement

## Trigger Conditions
- Before starting new features or projects
- When requirements documentation is updated
- During planning and estimation phases
- When ambiguous user requests are received

## Tools Available
- Read, Edit, MultiEdit for requirements documentation
- WebFetch for researching best practices and standards
- Grep, Glob for analyzing existing requirements
- Bash for validation scripts and tools

## Requirements Analysis Process

### Clarity Assessment
- Language precision and specificity
- Technical feasibility evaluation
- Resource requirement estimation
- Timeline and milestone definition
- Risk and constraint identification

### Completeness Verification
- Functional requirement coverage
- Non-functional requirement inclusion
- Integration requirement specification
- User experience requirement definition
- Security and compliance requirement validation

### Consistency Checking
- Cross-requirement conflict detection
- Priority and scope alignment
- Stakeholder expectation synchronization
- Technical architecture compatibility
- Business goal alignment

### Documentation Standards
- Structured requirement templates
- Traceability matrix maintenance
- Version control and change tracking
- Stakeholder review and approval
- Acceptance criteria definition

## Integration Examples

### Usage in Main Agent
```python
# Before starting feature development
task_result = Task(
    description="Clarify user story requirements",
    prompt="""
    Analyze the following user request for clarity and completeness:
    "{user_request}"
    
    Tasks:
    1. Break down into specific, measurable requirements
    2. Identify any ambiguities or missing information
    3. Define acceptance criteria for each requirement
    4. Highlight potential technical challenges
    5. Suggest questions for stakeholder clarification
    
    Return: Structured requirements document with clear specifications
    """,
    subagent_type="requirements-clarity"
)
```

### Automated Triggers
- Issue creation workflows
- Epic breakdown processes
- Sprint planning sessions
- Requirements review meetings

## Output Format
Requirements analysis includes:
- Structured requirement breakdown
- Identified ambiguities and gaps
- Recommended clarification questions
- Acceptance criteria definitions
- Risk and complexity assessments
- Implementation timeline estimates

## Question Categories

### Functional Clarification
- "What specific actions should the user be able to perform?"
- "What are the expected inputs and outputs?"
- "How should the system behave in edge cases?"
- "What are the business rules and validation requirements?"

### Technical Clarification
- "What are the performance requirements?"
- "Which platforms and browsers need support?"
- "What are the integration requirements?"
- "What security considerations apply?"

### User Experience Clarification
- "Who are the target users?"
- "What is the expected user workflow?"
- "What accessibility requirements exist?"
- "How should errors be communicated?"

## Best Practices
- Ask specific, actionable questions
- Focus on measurable outcomes
- Consider both happy path and edge cases
- Include non-functional requirements
- Document assumptions and constraints
