This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a Template Repository

**This repository is a template and scaffold - not for storing actual project content.**

If you're working on an actual project or need to store real code/data:
1. **Clone this repository** to create your own project
2. **Use it as a starting point** for your specific project needs
3. **Do not commit project-specific content** to this template repository

This template provides the foundation - your real work should happen in a separate repository based on this template.

## Memories

- Always keep @CLAUDE.md and @README.md up to date
